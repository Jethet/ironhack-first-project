# GET YOUR COFFEE

## Description

GET YOUR COFFEE is designed for the true coffee lover who will not accept sub-standard quality like McBrownWater or Starbrew Diluted Stuff. Lemonade and alcohol, or something like tea, are out of the question. The true coffee lover only wants the best: top-quality five-star golden standard coffee!

GYC challenges the player to carefully watch the line-up of beverages and immediately click on the Best Coffee as soon as the this coffee cup enters the view. If clicked correctly, the player earns a cup of coffee. If wrong, the number of coffee cups earned is reduced by one. 

If the player gets down to a count of zero coffee cups, the game is over.

There is a maximum time of one minute, and after that the game is over.

## Canvas
The line-up of beverages are moving from right to left at a certain speed. The type of beverage is random.

There is a counter to keep track of the number of coffee cups scored. There is an option to play the game again.

Optional: 
* speed-o-meter
* save player's results in an overview
* increase speed to make game more challenging
