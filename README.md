# GET YOUR COFFEE


## Description

GET YOUR COFFEE is designed for the true coffee lover who will not accept sub-standard quality like McBrownWater or Starbrew Diluted Stuff. Lemonade and alcohol, or something like tea, are out of the question. The true coffee lover only wants the best: top-quality five-star golden guaranteed high standard coffee!

GYC challenges the player to carefully watch the line-up of beverages, and immediately press the space bar as soon as the Best Coffee cup moves under the coffee machine. If done correctly, the player earns a cup of coffee. If the player forgets to click when the Best Coffee cup passes under the coffee machine, the coffee cup moves off the screen and the player's score is reduced by one. 

If the player gets down to a count of zero coffee cups, the game is over.

The player can play for a maximum time of one minute, and after that the game is over.


## MVP
The line-up of beverages are moving from right to left at a certain speed. The type of beverage is random.

There is a counter to keep track of the number of coffee cups scored. There is also a counter that keeps track of the time. On the Game Over screen there is an option to play the game again.


## Backlog
Optional: 
* speed-o-meter
* save player's results in an overview
* increase speed to make game more challenging
